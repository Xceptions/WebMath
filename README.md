# Image calculator
solves equations written on via hand on the web


## Overview
Use TensorFlow to generate short sequences of music with a [Restricted Boltzmann Machine](http://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html).

## Dependencies

  * Tensorflow
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * flask
  
Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies (pip install --upgrade ... ) 

### Dependencies on Windows with python3
```
    pip3 install pandas
    pip3 install flask
    pip3 install numpy
    pip3 install tensorflow (or compiled)
    pip3 install tqdm
```

## Basic Usage
To solve equations, simply clone this directory and run.
```
python app.py
```
Note: This work was trained on mnist dataset to recognize digits


The training data was gotten on kaggle. You can visit the site and just search for MNIST dataset
